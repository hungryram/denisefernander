# **How To Create Engaging Content and Products Without The Overwhelm**

Are you a mompreneur struggling to create copy for your business? Whether it’s your website, blog, digital product, coaching program or online course, no worries, because PLR is an easy and brilliant way to create engaging content.

Owning and operating a successful business that generates six figure revenues requires you to create clear and consistent content that resonates with your customer base. Sometimes it seems like creating content from scratch requires a lot of time, effort, and dedication and that can be a lot for us, mompreneurs, since we already have to juggle multiple tasks throughout the day. If you’re facing this predicament, using PLR content is a sure way to get rid of your content creation distress.

In this blog, I have put together information about the whats, whys, and hows of PLR content. You will also get to read about reliable PLR sites like PLR.me and why I use them. So, let’s dive in.

## What is PLR?

PLR stands for Private Label Rights, which allows entrepreneurs like you and me to purchase all the intellectual property rights of a work from its author. What makes it different from the resale of content is that buying PLR content allows you to edit and modify it before using it for your business. This is great since PLR content works as an outline and you can then create your content from it.

One of the best advantages of using PLR content is that you can use the content as a whole or parts of it, anywhere and any number of times that you want. Reusing and repurposing content is the BEST!

## Why Use PLR content?

As a mompreneur, creating content from scratch can be pretty overwhelming. Although some people tend to view PLR content as inferior, reinventing the wheel is rarely a bad idea. After all, even fresh content is one way of reinventing the wheel, as everything is a reimagination of something that inspires you. Here are some of the reasons why you should consider using PLR content regularly.

### 1. Saves Time

Content creation can be an arduous process. It takes some time and thinking to get those creative juices flowing. Using PLR content gives you a base outline to work with. So, you don’t have to be clueless as to how to go about your article. As I mentioned, PLR allows you to use content wholly or partially, thereby reducing the time you need to invest in creating content.

### 2. Prompts Your Creative Flow

A major issue I face as a mompreneur while making content is a creative block. Working through a creative block can take up a lot of time and effort sometimes, so why not save your time and effort and invest in your success. PLR content sorts out this problem because pre-written content is a great way to get your creative juices flowing.

Even if you’re not using the content as a whole, you can still gather various ideas from the different parts of a PLR article. Once you’re able to generate your own ideas, combining them with the PLR content and coming up with your niche content is an easy task.

### 3. Flexibility

Rather than reselling content, PLR allows you to modify and rebrand the work you bought according to your wishes. This way, your content will reflect your unique message. You can even choose to retain merely a sentence from the article and edit the rest.

Also, you can add images, illustrations, your name as the author, embedded links, and your own opinions anywhere you like within the article. This way, PLR allows you to be flexible with your content and rewrite it as much as you want. I absolutely advise/insist that you make modifications and consistently rewrite your articles to keep your authenticity.

### 4. Saves Money

To run a successful business, you should save and conserve money wherever you can. By opting for PLR content, you can eliminate the expenses of hiring someone else to make content for you and quickly create it on your own. Hiring a writer for, say, a 50-page article would cost you around $800, while a PLR ebook of 200 pages would cost only around $30. You can even resell the PLR content and easily get your money back within a few sales.

## Why I Use PLR.me

As a mompreneur, I’d recommend using the [PLR.me](https://www.plr.me/?ref=denisefernander) to access PLR content. It offers around 14,000 resources that are complete and cover a wide range of topics like wellness, business, personal development, finance, and health. The content includes articles, blog posts, social media posts, worksheets, presentations, audio content, video graphics, PDFs, etc. This website is primarily meant for life coaches, business coaches and health professionals, although many of the topics fit the needs of other entrepreneurs as well.

The PLR content available on [PLR.me](https://www.plr.me/?ref=denisefernander) is usually well-structured and uses good vocabulary and grammar. This will make your job much easier. The website also offers a smooth experience to the user, with an attractive design, writing ideas and a variety of structures.

[PLR.me](https://www.plr.me/?ref=denisefernander) offers 3 levels of account options including a free account, a pay as you go plan (starting at $22) and several monthly premium membership plans (starting at $99/month). The free option gives you 2 free credits every month and the other plans start at 10 credits. Most content require only 1 credit, but many bundles are available at discount credit amounts. With all of their plans you get access to the Ultimate Content Starter Kit which I’ve found to be very helpful.

There are often opportunities for you to jump in to the paid memberships at a deep discount so you can get a feel for how you can best benefit from the service. You’ll also be given access to bonus tools like their content autoloader, summary creator, marketing training videos and the Facebook Mastermind Group.

There are other sites out there like [PLR.me](https://www.plr.me/?ref=denisefernander) like [IDPLR](http://www.idplr.com/), and [Health & Wellness PLR](http://healthandwellnessplr.com/). Ultimately, the goal is for you to get going and done with your content and to find ways to streamline it so it is a regular part of what you do in your business.

## Reminder

There is one thing you always want to keep in mind when using PLR content. I highly recommend that you always edit and rewrite the content. Consistent modifications and edits will allow you to establish a unique voice for your brand as opposed to releasing the content as it is. It’s extremely important that you make changes every time you put out content because it helps to maintain the originality of your brand and your message.

## In Summary

Creating content is necessary at every level in your business so finding ways to make it 1) easy and 2) to help you stay consistent is key. That said, PLR content is an excellent way for mompreneurs to create content for their brands without getting overwhelmed and frustrated so you should most definitely give it a try.
