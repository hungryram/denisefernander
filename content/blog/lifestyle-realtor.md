Looking to connect, network, give and receive support and feedback from other local moms? We will explore successful business/personal strategies ranging from personal development, mindset, clearing emotional blockages, business development, goal setting, marketing strategies and accountability, etc.  
  
As a mompreneur (Mother + Entrepreneur) we juggle multiple roles daily and need support to help us balance our other roles as moms, wives, single moms, WAHM, women entrepreneurs and business owners.  
  
Our purpose is to provide a safe space for networking, supporting, and sharing resources and information. We will meet twice a month to network, learn, and mastermind to build and grow our businesses.
