    ## Nine years ago, I was burning the candle at both ends as a was a wife, mom, working full-time, had a home business I was trying to grow and everything else in between. In other words, I was stressed out, exhausted, sick, mentally foggy, and nearly dead!

    ## One of my doctors said he didn’t expect that I’d survive another 12 months after meeting him. Needless to say I was also **STRUGGLING** to get clear about my business and about my life. Young, married with a beautiful 8 year old son and 17 year old stepson, I knew I needed to hit the refresh button on my life. There was NO way this was going to be it for me.

    ## You see not only did I **WANT** to live, I **DESPERATELY** wanted to encourage my son’s interest in becoming an entrepreneur, as an example of **SUCCESS**. Both my mother and father were business owners and their parents before them. I knew I had to figure this out even if only to carry the legacy forward.

    ## So I know just what you’re going through. It was work, but I’ve made it past that and am living healthy, happy, peacefully and want to help you get to success as well! It’s my passion and my purpose! I have a roadmap that WORKS!

    ## Let’s talk. I’d love to know your story and how I can help.

    I’m an educator, certified speaker & accountability coach with MOMpreneur Success Academy. I help other mom entrepreneurs get clear and in 90 days grow their business toward their first $100K! I’m a former classroom teacher, online teacher, curriculum & instructional designer. I have also worked as a business & educational consultant for over 20 years.

    My experience in business, coaching, speaking, teaching, and curriculum design and relationship-building provided me the skills to help clients hone in on their passion, EXACTLY what their community wants and needs and help them build and grow a successful and sustainable online business. My greatest asset is my know howand experience!

    Are you **READY** for your **SUCCESS**?
